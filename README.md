# Color Picker

A simple color picker application made with the use of "colorjoe" library to create color picker widget.
In the app you can pick any color from color wheel, and get its value in HEX. 
You can also store and retrive up to five colors in storage pallete, - stored colors are cached into
local storage, so they won't be lost after page reload.
While page is loading, it is all blurry, and will get clear after all loadings are finished.
